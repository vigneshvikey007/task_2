                    <h2 style="color:red">About Fitness</h2><br><h4 style="color:azure;">It's important to choose activities you enjoy, as this will make it more likely that you'll stick with them in the long term.It's important to find a fitness routine that suits your preferences and lifestyle. Whether you enjoy team sports, solo workouts, or group classes, finding an activity you like can make it easier to incorporate fitness into your daily routine. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting a new fitness program, especially if you have underlying health conditions or concerns.Experts define physical fitness as <b>one's ability to execute daily activities with optimal performance, endurance, and strength with the management of disease, fatigue, and stress and reduced sedentary behavior.</b></h4>
                    <h2 style="color:red;">Importance</h2><h4 style="color:azure;"> Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.</h4>
                    <h2 style="color:red;">Fitness Management</h2><h4 style="color:azure;">Both eating patterns and physical activity routines play a critical role in weight management. You gain weight when you consume more calories through eating and drinking than the amount of calories you burn, including those burned during physical activity.

                        To maintain your weight: Work your way up to 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity, which could include dancing or yard work. You could achieve the goal of 150 minutes a week with 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.
                        
                        People vary greatly in how much physical activity they need for weight management. You may need to be more active than others to reach or maintain a healthy weight.
                        
                        To lose weight and keep it off: You will need a high amount of physical activity unless you also adjust your eating patterns and reduce the amount of calories youâ€™re eating and drinking. Getting to and staying at a healthy weight requires both regular physical activity and healthy eating.</h4>
